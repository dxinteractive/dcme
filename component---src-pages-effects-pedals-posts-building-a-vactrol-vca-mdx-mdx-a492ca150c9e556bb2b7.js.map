They're basically a volume control that can be set using a reference voltage. In a modular synth their primary job is make notes start and end, the volume is to raise when a key is pressed, and it's told to lower again when a key is released. The VCA simply reads the control voltage provided to it (often from 0V to 10V), and makes the audio signal quieter the closer the control voltage is to zero.`}</p>\n    <Image src={ShooshBreadboard} alt=\"Shoosh on a breadboard\" mdxType=\"Image\" />\n    <p>{`In the world of guitars you might not see much point in one of these, but altering the volume of a signal is the basis for tremolo pedals, the feedback and blend controls in delay pedals, and it provides compressors with their ability to squeeze.

I've found VCAs most useful as components within other effects.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Why vactrols? They're known to introduce minimum levels of noise compared to other types of VCA and they're easy to set up. You wouldn't use them for everything - their response is very non-linear, they differ from one another, and they are a little slow to turn on and off.
