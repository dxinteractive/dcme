It had a robot character performing examples of lots of different skate tricks with definitions. It became moderately well known, I think the link was even printed in Transworld skate magazine at one point. In a way it killed itself because there was a gigantic influx of web traffic, and I couldn't afford a web hosting upgrade so had to take it down.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I recently found these 400+ skate animtions and decided to revive it just a little, as a kind of animated infographic.`}</p>\n    <div style={{\n      position: 'relative',\n      paddingBottom: '52.91%',\n      marginBottom: '1rem'\n    }}>\n    <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DeafeningInexperiencedFerret' frameBorder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style={{\n        position: 'absolute',\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0\n      }} allowFullScreen />\n    </div>\n    <div style={{\n      position: 'relative',\n      paddingBottom: '52.91%',\n      marginBottom: '1rem'\n    }}>\n    <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/DisloyalFabulousBison' frameBorder='0' scrolling='no' width='100%' height='100%' style={{\n        position: 'absolute',\n        top: 0,\n        left: 0\n      }} allowFullScreen />\n    </div>\n    <h2>{`A few bonus notes`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Many of these tricks can be called a few different things. Like the 360 ollies with a kickflip or heelflip can be phrased in many ways, so I just called them what I always have. The point isn't to have a single name, but one that describes the trick in a way that other people can understand it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I called the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`crooked 5-0`}</strong>{` that rather than a suski grind because suski traditionally only refers to backside ones (that's the way Suski did them), where as the term crooked 5-0 can describe either. The frontside / backside restriction on suski's is slowly disappearing in common use, but I've always called those crooked 5-0s.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The same might be argued for salad grind, but 'overcrooked 5-0' certainly isn't common enough to warrant using it for the sake of keeping things hisorically accurate - most people I know on and off the internet use salad to describe both frontside and backside ones, and I'm going with what is common.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`losi grind`}</strong>{` isn't a misspelling of lazy grind - it's named after its inventor Alan Losi. You can still probably call it a lazy grind as that terms has become quite prevalent.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
